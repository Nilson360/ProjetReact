# ProjetReact MyMovie 
This is an academic project, developed in 2021 as part of my engineering studies at the Ecole Supérieure d'Informatique - École Hexagone

In this project we studied the reactNative framework for cross-platform mobile application development, android and iOS.
This was my first experience on fremowrok and we covered a lot of topics.

What is this application?

MyMovie is an application that serves to make a list of movies.

Come functionality you have:
- The possibility to add a movie, name, description and photo.
- The possibility to update it
- add a comment

While developing it we put into practice our knowledge of database (we made a CRUD) but also of react and javaScript.
